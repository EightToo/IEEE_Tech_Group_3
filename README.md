This is a copy of the hid_composite example from TinyUSB (https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/tree/master/examples/device/hid_composite)
showing how to build with TinyUSB when using the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK

simple pinout:

0-11 gpio pins are used for input

0-3            A,B,X,Y <br />
4-7            DPad (U,D,L,R) <br />
8 & 9          L & R Shoulder <br />
10 & 11        Select & Start <br />

havent tested the pinout just yet so ill do that soon.
